This Spring Boot app was generated by https://wupiter.com/accelerators/spring-boot-graphql-app-generator-BnvIFaTKiyAC3dB86pfk/generate.

In order to run the app, execute below command:
```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Once it's running, it will be available at http://localhost:8080/.

# GraphQL
The app was generated from the [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) schema found at demo-app/src/main/resources/graphql/schema.graphqls.

It has a controller, a service and a data access layer with methods derived from the schema's Queries and Mutations.

In order to test the GraphQL api, visit this page: http://localhost:9090/graphiql?path=/graphql.

# Spring MVC Controller
This layer is using Spring's experimental GraphQL starter dependency (see the pom.xml file) to expose the Queries and Mutations in the GraphQL schema, and it's delegating all calls to the service layer.

# Service layer
The service layer is where any business logic should be implemented. At the moment, it's only delegating calls to the data access layer.

The service layer also serves as a transaction demarcation: when the controller calls any of the methods in this layer, Spring will automatically start a new db transaction which will get commited after the method returned.

Spring's transaction management is enabled by the `@EnableTransactionManagement` used in the `JpaConfig` class.

See this guide for more details on transaction management: https://www.baeldung.com/transaction-configuration-with-jpa-and-spring.

# Spring Data JPA
The data access layer uses the Spring Data JPA library to communicate with the database, which is configured as an in-memory H2 database.

It uses repository classes generated from the Queries and Mutations defined in the GraphQL schema and JPA entities generated from Type definitions defined in the schema.

See here for more details on Spring Data JPA: https://www.baeldung.com/the-persistence-layer-with-spring-data-jpa.

Spring automatically takes care of generating the database tables based on the JPA entities. There's a simple H2 SQL client available at http://localhost:8080/h2-console, you can login using `sa` as username and an empty password. 

*** Warning: *** Make sure to use a different database for production.
